1.Importing libraries.
2.Loading and preprocessing the dataset.
3.Splitting the data into training and test sets.
4.Transforming text data into numerical features using TF-IDF vectorization.
5.Training a logistic regression model.
6.Evaluating the model's accuracy.
7.Making predictions on new data.
The model achieved high accuracy on both training and test datasets, effectively distinguishing between spam and ham emails.
